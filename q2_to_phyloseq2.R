#now, open txt file that was just made in Excel and split into two files:
#1) for taxonomy only (only OTUID and taxonomic info columns)
#Now, use 
###For this file, is taxonomy_only.csv in phyloseq folder
#use data â€”> text-to-columns in Excel and separate on semicolon to get columns for kingdom, phylum, class, etc

######ADDED KINGDOM, Phylum, calss, etc. as headings 
#and 2)for the OTU matrix (containing only OTUID and abundances in each sample.) 
######new with non-rarefied: nonrarefied_OTU_matrix.csv
